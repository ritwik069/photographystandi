            <p className='text-[14px] italic pl-[10px]'>
                We are a group of dreamers waiting for the chance to capture the dreams in your eyes, the emotions on your face and the love all around as you celebrate your special day. We capture the stories, the hearts on the sleeves, the fairytale moments and the tearful smiles to create memories of a lifetime for you to live and relive forever.
            </p>
            <p className='text-[14px] italic pl-[10px]'>
                Our team is focused on finding the aesthetics in a moment perfectly, to frame the memories in a perfect mix of modern and classic. Our first question to you will always be whatâ€™s the most important part of the event to you and our sole focus will be to capture it, on an album and in a film.
